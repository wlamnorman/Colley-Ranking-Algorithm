    "# Team Ranking based on Colley's method\n",
    "Resources used:\n",
    "- https://www.colleyrankings.com/matrate.pdf ($\\textbf{Colley's own description of the method}$ - reliable but bad notation and lengthy)\n",
    "- https://www.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~ale/dsta+dsat/dsta+dsat-3/lm-ch3-colley.pdf (watch out for small errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Method Description\n",
    "One can imagine a simple ranking system based on the winning percentage (of team $i$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_i = \\frac{w_i}{t_i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "the teams. Colley proposed a simple modification which\n",
    "- takes into account the opponent players strength\n",
    "- makes rankings \"zero sum\" (teams steal \"ranking score\", rankings does not really sum to 0, but $n_{\\text{teams}}/2$)\n",
    "- initially more stabler (a team who loses once does not have 0 ranking, but moves more slowly away from the teams' equilibrium)\n",
    "\n",
    "by instead using the (Laplace modified) winning percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r_i = \\frac{w_i+1}{t_i+2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider that we may write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_i = \\frac{w_i-l_i}{2} + \\frac{w_i+l_i}{2} = \\frac{w_i-l_i}{2} + \\frac{t_i}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we may estimate the $\\frac{t_i}{2}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{t_i} \\frac{1}{2} \\approx \\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{O}_i} n_{i,j} r_j $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{O}_i$ is the set of opponents of team i and $n_{i,j}$ is the number of matches between $i$ and $j$ (note that the approximation is justified by the fact that the equilibrium of ratings is $\\frac{1}{2}$, but the approximation may be bad if there are multiple teams who only wins and loses - should not be a problem in fair match ups or sports where domination is unusual). We may then write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_i \\approx \\frac{\\frac{w_i-l_i}{2} - \\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{O}_i} n_{i,j} r_j +1}{t_i+2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, using this approximation, we now have that the rating of one team is dependent on the other teams. Further, we see that the equation is a system of $n_{\\text{teams}}$ equations with $n_{\\text{teams}}$ variables as $i \\in \\{ 1,2,...,n_{\\text{teams}} \\}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ (t_i + 2)r_i - \\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal{O}_i} n_{i,j} r_j = \\frac{w_i-l_i}{2} + 1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "or, in matrix form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Cr = b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $b_i = \\frac{w_i-l_i}{2} +1 $ and the diagonal elements of $C$ are $C_{i,i}=t_i+2$ and the off-diagonal elements are $C_{i,j} = -n_{i,j}$ for $i \\neq j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that $C$ is symmetric, real and positive definite (discussed by Colley) hence $C$ can be subjected to Cholesky decomposition."
